/*Avoid using built-in functions to solve this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Implement a function that takes two strings, s and x, as arguments and finds the first occurrence of the string x in s. The function should return an integer indicating the index in s of the first occurrence of x. If there are no occurrences of x in s, return -1.

Example

    For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IA", the output should be
    strstr(s, x) = -1;
    For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IsA", the output should be
    strstr(s, x) = 10.

Input/Output

    [time limit] 3000ms (java)

    [input] string s

    A string containing only uppercase or lowercase English letters.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ s.length ≤ 106.

    [input] string x

    String, containing only uppercase or lowercase English letters.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ x.length ≤ 106.

    [output] integer
